You are given a dataset which consists of the petal and sepal measurements of iris flowers. 
The problem is to find the category of flower (Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica, Iris Versicolor) given the measurements of a particular flower.
Create models using KNN and Na√Øve Bayes and find the best of the two models used.
Use python to prepare the data and create the models and cross-validate the dataset. 
Please make sure you also use appropriate performance measures, error values, bias and variance to come to conclusion of the best dataset
